  "decision": "Will you manage APIs OpenAPI-first (import and update from spec) or portal-first (manual operations), and how will you handle breaking changes?",
  "whyItMatters": [
    "API lifecycle choices affect consumer stability and your ability to apply changes safely.",
    "A consistent import/update model reduces drift between spec, APIM configuration, and backend implementation.",
    "Change strategy determines how you communicate and enforce versions and deprecation."
  ],
  "portalSteps": [
    "Import an API (OpenAPI where possible) and review operations, request/response shapes, and backend mapping.",
    "Decide a versioning strategy (path, header, or query) and keep it consistent across the API program.",
    "Use revisions to stage non-breaking changes and validate before releasing broadly.",
    "Document which changes require a new API version vs a revision."
  ],
  "validation": [
    "Validate imported operations match backend routing and authentication.",
    "Test old and new versions/revisions in parallel if consumers are already integrated.",
    "Confirm policy behavior after import/update (especially at API/operation scope)."
  ],
  "pitfalls": [
    "Importing a spec but then manually editing operations (drift over time).",
    "No standard for breaking changes (clients get surprised).",
    "Applying policies at multiple scopes without conventions."
