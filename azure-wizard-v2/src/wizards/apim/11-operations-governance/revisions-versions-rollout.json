  "description": "A practical rollout model for APIM changes that reduces risk for client environments.",
  "decision": "How will you ship changes (policies, APIs, products) without breaking consumers and without editing production in-place?",
  "whyItMatters": [
    "A defined rollout model reduces incidents caused by unreviewed policy changes.",
    "Revisions help you validate before making changes effective for all traffic.",
    "Clients often require change control evidence and rollback steps."
  ],
  "portalSteps": [
    "Define environments (dev/test/prod) and avoid applying untested changes directly in prod.",
    "Use API revisions to stage changes and validate with test traffic before release.",
    "Document what constitutes a breaking change that requires a version change.",
    "For policy updates, test in lower environments and validate failure modes before promotion."
  ],
  "validation": [
    "Run regression tests for key APIs after each policy change (auth, throttling, routing, logging).",
    "Verify rollback steps are documented and executable within the change window.",
    "Confirm monitoring detects regressions quickly after release."
  ],
  "pitfalls": [
    "Editing production policies directly without staged validation.",
    "No rollback plan for policy changes that block traffic.",
    "Inconsistent versioning conventions across APIs."
